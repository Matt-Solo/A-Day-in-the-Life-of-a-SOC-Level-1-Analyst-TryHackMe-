## 🧑‍💻 A Day in the Life of a Junior (Associate) Security Analyst

This repository documents my hands-on experience completing the **TryHackMe simulation** designed to reflect the role of a Tier 1 SOC Analyst. In this lab, I worked through a real-world alert triage scenario using a virtual SOC dashboard, mimicking enterprise security operations.

---

### 🔍 My Responsibilities During the Simulation

- **Lab Environment Setup**: Launched a simulated SOC dashboard with tools like SIEM, IDS/IPS, email logs, and network monitoring—designed to mirror real-world conditions.
- **Alert Review & Ticket Analysis**: Identified and prioritized alerts using details such as alert type, source/destination IPs, and detection timestamps.
- **Log Investigation**: Examined IDS/IPS logs, email headers, and network activity for indicators of compromise like suspicious files, brute-force attempts, or data exfiltration.
- **Threat Intelligence Validation**: Used OSINT tools like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and Shodan to validate malicious IPs, file hashes, and domains.
- **Question-Based Assessment**: Answered targeted questions about the nature of the attack, affected users, and IOCs, reinforcing my investigative process.
- **Remediation Planning**: Suggested containment actions such as blocking the IP, isolating affected hosts, and resetting credentials—highlighting my understanding of incident response best practices.
